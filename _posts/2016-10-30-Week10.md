<b>What did I do this past week?</b><br>
<p>This past week we had only one lecture followed with a presentation from a company then a day off on friday.</p>
<b>What's in my way?</b><br>
<p>The next week I'll have two projects, an Algo test, two homeworks and a paper due. So it's going to be hell!</p>
<b>What will I do next week?</b><br>
<p>The beginning of the week I'll be studying hard for the Algo test. Once thats done I'll put all my attention on the projects. No gym for me this coming week.</p>
