<b>What did I do this past week?</b><br>
<p>This past week I studied for and took the SWE exam. I felt it was a fair exam that allowed you to show how well you know Python. I studied very hard for the exam but still felt that I wasn't well prepared. I need to make sure I'm more prepared for the next exam. The one thing I got caught up on the exam was the material we learned the day before. </p>

<b>What's in my way?</b><br>
<p>I will be juggling two major projects this next month. It will get tougher but I will learn a lot and look forward to it! </p>

<b>What will I do next week?</b><br>
<p>This next week I will be starting the projects and try to get a head start on the work. </p>

<p>I'm excited about the upcoming projects. I never done any full stack coding and feel this is something that is still a mystery to me. The school load is about to get heavy so I'll have to focus even harder to keep my grades up. </p>

<p>One of the things we learned this past week was packing and unpacking arguments for function calls and parameter lists. We also learned more about the range function, which can increment and also decrement the numbers list. Learning these different aspects and functionality of Python will be useful for interview questions. I'm starting to realize when Downing says that Python is beautiful.</p>

<b>Tip of the Week</b><br>
<p>I've heard the projects can be labor intensive so start early. </p>
