<b>What did I do this past week?</b><br>
<p>This past week I worked on the front end of our project. Ultimatley it didn't get added to the final submission.</p>

<b>What's in my way?</b><br>
<p>Nothing is in my way. Looking forward to Thanksgiving!</p>

<b>What will I do next week?</b><br>
<p>This next week I will focus on studying for the upcoming exam. I need to understand the concepts better that we have covered this past month. We covered many different topics coming to this last exam.</p>

<p>This past week we had a presentation from Spice Works. The two individuals were Keith Epley and Lee Green. They went over the technologies they use and created to make there job easier. For example, they created Spice Bot which is a chat application. Also part of their presentation they went over tips to help us getting hired into the technology field. They stressed on tailoring your resume to the specific company. Do our research and find out which technologies they use and rearrange your resume to hightlight that you are the best candidate for the position. Many students list coursework that every other student has taken so they suggested not mentioning those projects/coursework.</p>

<p>For the other two class lectures we finished the strategy patterns and singleton principle </p>
