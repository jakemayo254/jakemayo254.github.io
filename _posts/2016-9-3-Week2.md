<b>What did I do this past week?</b><br>
<p>This past week I've focused on my other classes so that next week I can just focus on the project</p>

<b>What's in my way?</b><br>
<p>I need to put more time into the readings to be better prepared for the quizs</p>


<b>What will I do next week?</b><br>
<p>Learn all the technologies needed for Project 1</p>

<p>With my high course load this semester I need to be better organized so I don't miss any classes or assignment due dats. I'm starting to realize how labor intensive this class will be with both coding and readings. So what I did was buy a calendar and mapped out all due dates for all my classes by color. Having a clear understanding of my schedule will allow me to not miss a day of class and get a 0 on the quiz.</p>

<p>The class material seems very pratical for the real world and definalty feel that I will become a better and more efficient program once this course is over. Alot of the code we worked on this past week was focused on debugging or improving the effiency of the code. Dr. Downing also went through the process of working on a project from start to finish. This whole process I've never been familiar with. </p>

<b>Tip of the Week</b><br>
<p>When it comes to resume paper use the thickest/nicest paper possible... when the recruitors are going through hundreds of resumes yours wont literally fall through the cracks!</p>
